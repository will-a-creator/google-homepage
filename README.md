# test909

For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it.
Don’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. 
The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

Try not too....Using the browser’s developer tools (right-clicking something on the page and clicking “inspect element” 
will get you there) will be your best friend. Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser
to check it out.

BASICALLY....just replicate the default google homepage using developer tools if needed.
